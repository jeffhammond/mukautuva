# Mukautuva

Mukautuva means "adaptable" in Finnish.  The purpose of Mukautuva (MUK for short) is to allow one to compile 
an MPI application once against the MUK ABI, which is a prototype of the MPI-5 ABI we are developing,
and run using any MPI implementation.

Currently, we support Open-MPI, MPICH and Intel MPI.  The latter two are already ABI-compatible, while
MPICH and Open-MPI are quite different.  Internally, MUK supports MPICH and Open-MPI, so if you use an
MPI ABI that is not based on either of these, some work may be required.  However, as long as an MPI
implementation handle is compatible with an `int`, a `void*`, or an `intptr_t`, then the only work to
support it is detection.

To use MUK, you compile using the implementation-agnostic parts with the system C compiler.
You must tell the build system which `mpicc` to use for MPICH and Open-MPI.
At runtime, you must use the appropriate `mpirun` for your implementation, which is specified
by `MPI_LIB=<path to libmpi.so>`.  MUK knows the defaults for some systems so you can use
`mpirun` and not set `MPI_LIB` and it will probably work.

You configure the build system by editing the top of `Makefile`.
More complex build systems are a pointless distraction and will not be supported.

# Current status

The overwhelming majority of features are working, including all the common ones.

## Successes

The following are known to work:
- The [ARMCI-MPI](https://github.com/pmodels/armci-mpi) test suite, which exercises passive target RMA and some interesting group and communicator features.
- The OSU MPI Benchmarks ([OMB](https://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/)), which test MPI performance.
- The Intel MPI Benchmarks ([IMB](https://github.com/intel/mpi-benchmarks)), which test MPI performance, including I/O.
- Most of the MPICH test suite, with exceptions noted below.

Specifically, the following MPICH test groups are passing:
- Attributes: see below.
- Basic: all OK.
- Collectives: all except `p_scan` (see below).
- Comm: all OK.
- Datatypes: all OK.
- Group: all OK.
- Initialization: see below.
- IO: all OK.
- P2P: 61/66 passing. Failures related to `MPI_Fint`, `PMPI_Message_f2c`, generalized requests - all of which are known issues - and https://github.com/jeffhammond/mukautuva/issues/19, which needs to be debugged.
- RMA: all except keyval- and errhandler-related.
- Topology: all OK.

## Known Issues

- Attributes and errhandler stuff with custom callbacks as well as grequests are not yet implemented.  The only user-defined callbacks that are implemented right now are user-defined reductions, which are the most important ones.
- Mukautuva leaks state in in persistent reductions (e.g. `MPI_Scan_init`) with user-defined ops.  This is fixable but low priority.
- Spawn is not supported.  Simple cases would work, but the shared-library lookup situation is more complicated with Spawn on multiple nodes.
- Most of the things that are supposed to work before MPI_Init donâ€™t, because i need to reorganize all the dlsym init stuff to make that work.
- Sessions are not supported because they are a more complicated version of the "before init" problem.
- Fortran interoperability features (handle conversion) are ignore.  These will be implemented in conjunction with [VAPAA](https://github.com/jeffhammond/vapaa) at some point.

There are things that do not work because the underlying implementation does not support them yet.  For example, MPICH has a bug with `MPI_BOTTOM` throwing an error when it shouldn't, and Open-MPI does not support much of MPI-4 right now.

Hui Zhou and Ken Raffineti of the MPICH team were extremely helpful when debugging a number of issues with Mukautuva.

My team at NVIDIA allowed me to focus on this project for the month it took to create.
